This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators for an E-commerce business. The dashboard is stored in the file `E commerce sales.pbix` and has been designed to offer data-driven insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. It enables business users and stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time, interactive analytics.

The primary objective of this dashboard is to streamline the understanding of E-commerce sales data through a well-structured and intuitive interface. It presents various visuals, including bar and line charts, KPI indicators, pie charts, and slicers. These elements help users track vital metrics such as total revenue, profit margins, number of orders, customer acquisition, and product-wise sales distribution. The dashboard also incorporates filters that allow the user to drill down into specific time periods, product categories, regions, or customer segments.

Built entirely in Power BI Desktop, the dashboard uses DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures and calculated fields that enhance the analytical depth of the report. This includes dynamic metrics such as month-over-month growth, top-selling products, average order value, and customer retention indicators.

To get started, download or clone this repository and open the `E commerce sales.pbix` file using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/), which is freely available for Windows. Once opened, you can explore the pre-built report pages or connect the dashboard to your own dataset by updating the data source. The visuals and filters can be customized further depending on the business needs or the structure of your data.

This dashboard is ideal for E-commerce analysts, sales managers, business development teams, and startup founders who want a quick, visual overview of their sales performance. It supports exploratory analysis and helps in identifying trends, anomalies, and opportunities for growth.
